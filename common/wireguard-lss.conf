# Currently, running three concurrent interfaces is supported
# Leave the 2nd and/or 3rd blank if you're only running one!
#
# Note - If you are using 3 interfaces (seems OK with 2), you will likely need
# to use a systemd dropin for wg-quick@.service to introduce a delay in order
# to have all 3 of them come up in the container.  Without the delay, iptables
# can error out due to the previous wg interface still having it in a locked
# state.
#
# Example on the base container:
#  systemctl edit wg-quick@.service
#
#  [Service]
#  ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/sleep 3
